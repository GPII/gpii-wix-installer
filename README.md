# Windows Installer for the GPII Framework

A WiX-based Windows installer for the GPII's real-time framework. This code generates an installer for end users. 
Full instructions for installation by end users are available on the wiki page [Installing the GPII](http://wiki.gpii.net/w/Installing_the_GPII).

The installer can also be used by vendors or developers of third-party accessibility solutions (both assistive technologies and mainstream software with accessibility features) who want to integrate their product with GPII. 

Developers who want to contribute to the GPII framework should not use this installer but instead follow the instructions on the wiki page [Setting Up Your Development Environment](http://wiki.gpii.net/w/Setting_Up_Your_Development_Environment).
